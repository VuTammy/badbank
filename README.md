# Front End Bank Coding Assignment
## This is an assignment for MIT xPro Full stack development with MERN week 18

### Description/Purpose
The instructions for this assignment was to deploy a "Bad Bank" to AWS using a react app. The Bank Bank website inlcudes a home page and a navigation bar that allows the user to switch between pages. There is a create account and login page where the user can input their information to get started. There is a deposit and withdraw function that adds and subtracts money from the users balance. And lastly, there is an "All Data" page where the users information is stored. 

*How to run*: Download the files, start server, and open on browser.

*Usage*: Education

*Support*: Please contact

*Roadmap*: Unfortunately for this project I was unable to successfully initialize my project using the create react app. And because of that, I was unable to deploy the website to AWS. I will continue to work on this project and fix the issues it has with react. 

*License*: MIT License the instructions for this project
